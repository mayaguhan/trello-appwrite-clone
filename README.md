# Trello Clone with Appwrite and ChatGPT Integration

This project is a Trello clone integrated with Appwrite and ChatGPT. It demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development, including frontend UI/UX design, backend implementation, and integration with third-party services.

By integrating Appwrite, a backend-as-a-service platform, and ChatGPT, a language model, this project showcases my ability to work with APIs and incorporate external services into an application. It demonstrates my skills in building a robust task management and collaboration platform similar to Trello.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Create boards, lists, and cards to manage tasks and projects effectively.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Intuitive user interface with drag-and-drop functionality for easy task organization.
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Seamlessly integrate ChatGPT for intelligent chat-based interactions and assistance within the application.

## Demo

A live demo of the application is available at https://trello-appwrite-clone-two.vercel.app/.

## Additional Information

Please note that this project was developed as a learning experience, following a YouTube live stream/tutorial. The original tutorial can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI2AvfCj5oM&t=2186s. I will be making modifications by adding unique features to enhance its functionality and showcase my problem-solving skills.
